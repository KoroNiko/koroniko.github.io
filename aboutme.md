---

Hello! I'm Nikos, coming from Greece and currently residing in Leuven, Belgium. Currently, my life revolves around the following things:

- Studying Artificial Intelligence at KU Leuven
- Working as a software developer at [SoundTalks NV](https://www.soundtalks.com/)
- Self-studying on different frameworks (Computer Vision, TensorFlow, Django, ...)
- Reading books, going for runs or cooking (sometimes) delicious foods

I mainly work with the Python :snake: ecosystem, some examples being:

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Plotly / Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/learn)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- ...

I have a passion for solving problems, collaborating with people and hopefully turning out to be a better person each day.

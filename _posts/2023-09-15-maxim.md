As you all most know, there is a [war waging in Ukraine](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60525350) since 2022. Many people have died and there is no apparent end to this invasion for the forthcoming period. This means that more and more Ukrainians are recruited to fight in the front, risking their lives to protect their countries and families.

This brings us to my friend, Maxim. I first met him in junior high school. His family had immigrated to Greece in search for a better life. Years later, his family moved back again to Ukraine as a result of the Greek economic crisis of 2009. He managed to build a life in Ukraine, start a family and have a beautiful child.
